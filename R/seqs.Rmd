# Sequences

`seq_len()` can be used to get a vector of indices as long as the number provided  
e.g.

```{r seq-len}
seq_len(5)

vec_length <- 7
seq_len(vec_length)
```

Rather than working out the length of a vector with `length()` and passing that to `seq_len()`, you can use `seq_along()` and directly provide the vector.  
e.g.
```{r seq-along}
seq_along(letters[1:13])
```

It can also be used with a list, where you get a vector as long as the number of items in the list.
```{r seq-along-list}
seq_along(vector(mode = 'list', length = 7L))
```

For a data.frame you get a vector as long as the number of columns.

```{r df}
library('palmerpenguins')
ncol(penguins)
seq_along(penguins)
```
